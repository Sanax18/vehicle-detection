# vehicle-detection
This is a simple project made with YOLO and ultralytics in which we make detections in vehicles (such as bikes, cars, trucks, etc.). 

This project is intended to bring a solution to the society, including a complete webpage with statistics and data registration. More details will be deployed soon.
